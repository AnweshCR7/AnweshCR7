    <p>
    Welcome to my repository. I am a final year Master Student at TU Delft pursuing Masters in Data Science. This is a collection of all(most) of my projects. Actively looking for  opportunities in the field Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence for summer 2021.
    <br><br>
    I am a highly motivated learner with a predisposition towards exploring new fields and technologies. Currently working towards a potential career at the intersection of Sports and Data Science, specifically targetting Computer Vision and Machine Learning.

Apart from that, I am an avid football fan (Glory Glory, Manchester United), and I love meeting new people as it allows me to gain a better perspective at life. Interested in AI projects and ideas which I pursue part time. Confidence and Conscientiousness are two words that describe me aptly.
